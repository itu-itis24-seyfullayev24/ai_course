        <strong>Welcome</strong> to our Deep Learning A-Z course!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Congratulations</strong>, you took a great first action starting
        it, but now we want to motivate you to really learn Deep Learning and
        finish the course.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          That's why we are giving you a challenge, which starts right now:
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you manage to complete this course in less than{" "}
        <strong>6 weeks</strong>, we will give you{" "}
        <strong>an incredible Prize</strong> right after. Here is what we will
        send you:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>6 Deep Learning use cases we do with ChatGPT</strong>.
            <strong> </strong>We recorded one very clear hands-on tutorial for
            each use case so you will get 6 video lectures plus the codes of
            each tutorial. What ChatGPT can do has blown my mind, it's really
            incredible you'll see.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>6 Deep Learning PDF Cheatsheets</strong>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To take the challenge, here are the three simple steps you need to
        follow:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Starting from now, you complete the course within six weeks.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>

            <strong>with a screenshot of your certificate of completion</strong>{" "}
            which you will get after completing all the lectures. Or, if you are
            happy to share your certificate on LinkedIn, feel free to do so{" "}
            <strong>and mention me (@Hadelin de Ponteves, Hon. PhD)</strong> in
            the post so that I can see it. And then because I have a LinkedIn
            Premium account, I will be able to send you a message (InMail) with
            the Prize (which I will do quickly because I am very active on
            LinkedIn).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Then I will just check that you subscribed to this course less than
            six weeks before the moment you sent me the certificate of
            completion, and if so, I will immediately send you the Prize.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        You can totally do it, so never stop learning, and enjoy Deep Learning!

        <strong>PPS:</strong> We now attribute different weights to our courses
        having the challenge, so that students who complete the longer courses
        get more entries in the draw. Since Deep Learning A-Z is a long course
        with a 6-week challenge,{" "}
        <strong>
          you will get 4 entries in the draw by completing this course
